  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Create Flashable Zip:</strong>
    <p>To create a flashable zip, you need to package the TWRP image into a zip file. <br>
      You can use tools like Android Image Kitchen or manually create the zip structure. <br>
      The structure should look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
      META-INF/
        com/
          google/
            android/
              update-binary
              updater-script
      recovery/
        twrp.img
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>update-binary</code> and <code>updater-script</code> files are essential for the flashing process.<br>
       You can find templates for these files online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Flash the Zip:</strong>
    <p>Place the zip file on your phone's storage and flash it using TWRP. <br>
      Navigate to the "Install" section in TWRP, select the zip file, and swipe to confirm the flash.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Following these steps will help you create and flash a custom TWRP zip from an image. <br>
  Always ensure you have backups before proceeding with any modifications.</p>
